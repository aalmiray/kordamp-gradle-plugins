Provides conditional configuration blocks, similar to Apache Maven's {link_maven_profiles}. Configuration
blocks are applied immediately when their activation condition is met.

.Are profiles really needed?
This is a question that many Gradle users have asked themselves, specially if coming from Maven. On the surface profiles
are just a way to conditionally enable blocks of configuration. Given that Gradle relies on full programmatic DSLs
(Groovy or Kotlin) one would think that profile support such as this is superfluous, just use a series of `if` conditions
and move on.

True. Except when those conditions are

* More complex than merely checking the existence of a project property.
* Repeated in project after project in a given team or organization.
* Subject to enviromental activation (OS, JDK, etc).

In this case a custom plugin is likely to emerge, thus the existence of this plugin. Besides, this plugin provides newcomers
form Maven with a similar experience to get started off the ground. Later one can move to more idiomatic Gradle ways if
the facilities provided bny this plugin prove to be too constrained or inadecuate.

== DSL

[source,groovy]
----
profiles {
    profile(String) {
        activation {
            os { ... }
            jdk { ... }
            file { ... }
            property { ... }
            custom { ... }
        }
        allActivations {
            os { ... }
            jdk { ... }
            file { ... }
            property { ... }
            custom { ... }
        }
        anyActivations {
            os { ... }
            jdk { ... }
            file { ... }
            property { ... }
            custom { ... }
        }
        action {
            // regular project configuration
        }
    }
}
----

These are the rules that govern the DSL:

* Every profile must have an unique `id`.
* Only one of `activation`, `allActivations`, or `anyActivations` should be defined. In the case that multiple definitions
were to be present, the last one overrides any previous blocks.
* Every activation in `allActivations` must be true to activate the profile.
* The first activation in `anyActivations` that evaluates to true will activate the profile.
* Profiles may define no activations. They can only be activated by id.
* There is no default profile activation like there is in Maven.
* Profiles must have an action.

== Activations

There are 5 types of activations available in the `profiles` DSL

.os
[source,groovy]
----
os {
    name
    arch
    version
    release
    classifier
    classifierWithLikes
}
----

Where each property defines elements to be matched (exactly or as regex)

[horizontal]
name:: The expected OS name. Type = `String`.
arch:: The expected OS architecture. Type = `String`.
version:: The expected OS version. Type = `String`.
release:: The expected OS release (Linux). Type = `String`.
classifier:: The expected OS classifier. Type = `String`.
classifierWithLikes:: Additional classifiers. Type = `List<String>`.

.jdk
[source,groovy]
----
jdk {
    version
}
----

[horizontal]
version:: The version number to match. It may be a version prefix, such as `1.8`, or a version range,
such as `[1.7,1.8)`. Type = `String`.

.file
[source,groovy]
----
file {
    exists
    missing
}
----

[horizontal]
exists:: The given file must exist. Type = `RegularFile`.
missing:: The given file must *not* exist. Type = `RegularFile`.

.custom
[source,groovy]
----
custom {
    activation { Project p ->
        // custom condition against Project p
    }
}
----

.property
[source,groovy]
----
property {
    key
    value
}
----

[horizontal]
key:: The name of the property (required). Type = `String`.
value:: The value of the property (optional). Type = `String`.

Usage rules:

* This activation block can match environment variables, system properties, and/or project properties.
* Environment variables are always uppercased and require `env.` as prefix in the key.
* System properties require `systemProp.` as prefix in the key.
* Project properties names are used as is in the key.
* If the `value` is omitted then the activation only checks for the existence of the `key`. If the `key` is prefixed by a `!`
then the condition is inverted, i.e, the activation checks that the `key` does not exist.
* If the `value` is given then the property's value must match it. If the `value` is prefixed with a `!` then the given value
must not match.

Examples:

[source,groovy]
.Environment variable SECRET_TOKEN must exist
----
property {
    key = 'env.SECRET_TOKEN'
}
----

[source,groovy]
.System property server_ip must not exist
----
property {
    key = '!systemProp.server_ip'
}
----

[source,groovy]
.Project property must match value
----
property {
    key   = 'region'
    value = 'Frankfurt'
}
----

[source,groovy]
.Project property must not match value
----
property {
    key   = 'release'
    value = '!false'
}
----

== Explicit Activation

Profiles can be explicitly activated on the command line when their id is supplied as a project property. This will bypass
their activation condition if they happen to have one. This behavior can be triggered by setting a project property
named `profile` whose value is a comma separated list of profile ids.

[source,groovy]
.Example
----
profiles {
    profile('jdk9') {
        activation {
            jdk { version = '9' }
        }
        action { ... }
    }
    profile('jdk11') {
        activation {
            jdk { version = '11' }
        }
        action { ... }
    }
    profile('test') {
        action { ... }
    }
    profile('prod') {
        action { ... }
    }
}
----

The following command invocations have these results:

[source]
.Builds with jdk9 and prod profiles
----
gm -Pprofile=jdk9,prod build
----

[source]
.Builds with jdk11 profile only
----
gm -Pprofile=jdk11 build
----

In both cases the `test` profile remains inactive.

== System Properties

[horizontal]
profiles.enabled:: Disables or enables the whole `profiles` block. Default is `true`.

[[_org_kordamp_gradle_profiles_tasks]]
== Tasks

[[_task_active_profiles]]
=== ActiveProfiles

Displays all profiles that have been activated with the current configuration.

[horizontal]
Name:: activeProfiles
Type:: `org.kordamp.gradle.plugin.profiles.tasks.ActiveProfilesTask`

[[_task_display_activation_info]]
=== DisplayActivationInfo

Displays information used for profile activation.

[horizontal]
Name:: displayActivationInfo
Type:: `org.kordamp.gradle.plugin.profiles.tasks.DisplayActivationInfoTask`

[[_task_list_profiles]]
=== ListProfiles

Displays all configured profiles regardless of their activation state.

[horizontal]
Name:: listProfiles
Type:: `org.kordamp.gradle.plugin.profiles.tasks.ListProfilesTask`

==== Example Output

[source]
----
$ gm :displayActivationInfo

> Task :displayActivationInfo
JDK:
    version: 1.8.0-191
    major: 1
    minor: 8
    incremental: 0
    build: 191
    qualifier: null
OS:
    name: osx
    arch: x86_64
    version: 10.14
    classifier: osx-x86_64

This information can be used in conjuction with the {link_gradle_enforcer_plugin} to match the
{link_require_java_version} and {link_require_os} rules.
